     picture this a machine that could organize your cupboard just as you like it or serve every member of the house a customized cup of coffee makes your day easier doesn't it these are the products of artificial intelligence but why use the term artificial intelligence well these machines are artificially incorporated with human-like intelligence to perform tasks as we do this intelligence is built using complex algorithms and mathematical functions but ai may not be as obvious as in the previous examples in fact ai is used in smartphones cars social media feeds video games banking surveillance and many other aspects of our daily life the real question is what does an ai do at its core here is a robot we built in our lab which is now dropped onto a field in spite of a variation in lighting landscape and dimensions of the field the ai robot must perform as expected this ability to react appropriately to a new situation is called generalized learning the robot is now at a crossroad one that is paved and the other rocky the robot must determine which path to take based on the circumstances this portrays the robot's reasoning ability after a short stroll the robot now encounters a stream that it cannot swim across using the plank provided as an input the robot is able to cross this stream so our robot uses the given input and finds the solution for a problem this is problem solving these three capabilities make the robot artificially intelligent in short ai provides machines with the capability to adapt reason and provide solutions well now that we know what ai is let's have a look at the two broad categories an ais classified into weak ai also called narrow ai focuses solely on one task for example alphago is a maestro of the game go but you can't expect it to be even remotely good at chess this makes alphago a weak ai you might say alexa is definitely not a weak ai since it can perform multiple tasks well that's not really true when you ask alexa to play despacito it picks up the keywords play and despacito and runs a program and is trained to alexa cannot respond to a question it isn't trained to answer for instance try asking alexa the status of traffic from work to home alexa cannot provide you this information as she is not trained to and that brings us to our second category of ai strong ai now this is much like the robots that only exist in fiction as of now ultron from avengers is an ideal example of a strong ai that's because it's self-aware and eventually even develops emotions this makes the ai's response unpredictable you must be wondering well how is artificial intelligence different from machine learning and deep learning we saw what ai is machine learning is a technique to achieve ai and deep learning in turn is a subset of machine learning machine learning provides a machine with the capability to learn from data and experience through algorithms deep learning does this learning through ways inspired by the human brain this means through deep learning data and patterns can be better perceived ray kurzweil a well-known futurist predicts that by the year 2045 we would have robots as smart as humans this is called the point of singularity well that's not all in fact elon musk predicts that the human mind and body will be enhanced by ai implants which would make us partly cyborgs so here's a question for you which of the below ai projects don't exist yet a an ai robot with citizenship b a robot with a muscular skeletal system c ai that can read its owner's emotions d ain't that develops emotions over time give it a thought and leave your answers in the comment section below three lucky winners will receive amazon gift vouchers since the human brain is still a mystery it's no surprise that ai2 has a lot of unventured domains for now ai is built to work with humans and make our tasks easier however with the maturation of technology we can only wait and watch what the future of ai holds for us well that is artificial intelligence for you in short do not forget to leave your answer to the quiz in the comment section below also like share and subscribe to our channel if you enjoyed this video stay tuned and keep learning [Music] you

     this machine learning course starts at the beginning and goes all the way to an advanced level teaching you both the theory and applications of machine learning concepts ayush who teaches this course is a data scientist and machine learning engineer hi everyone and welcome to this course of machine learning this course will teach you machine learning from very basics to an advanced level in machine learning in this course this and this course will be having both theoretical plus practical understanding of machine learning algorithms and building real world ai projects after this course you will be you will be able to build your own machine learning applications and real-world applications and many domains okay but wait first who am i my name is ayush and i'm a data scientist at artifact i'm in standard nine from india i've worked on various applications of artificial intelligence like machine learning deep learning i've worked on various domains from deep learning which is another computer vision generative adversarial networks and nash language processing i've also contributed to the large ai projects and routine by andana okay so this is this is my basic uh skills and also i run a small youtube channel which is not as near now not a small a big youtube channel which is around we have a 500 members where we when i where i make a content on machine learning deep learning and various ai things and i put end-to-end courses there currently deep learning course is being launched so you can start watching after this completing that start this course that deep learning course okay so that's that's that is from my side and you can connect me on linkedin if you want to know over more about me and i've also cleared some microsoft exams so you can get to know more about there about me okay i'm also a founder of android and ai tech platform and also product based platform okay so that's it from my side and i hope that you will get a lot more from this course now let's discuss the syllabus of this course we will start with the very basics of machine learning covering the fundamentals of machine learning in the section number one and then it will go further into understanding some algorithms like linear regression a logistic regression support victim machine principal common analysis learning theory and some in symbol learning methods like bagging boosting stacking cascading and then we'll talk about unsupervised learning and you may think yeah you sure you would you wanted to teach this much no absolutely no in this this is a 10 plus hours of course so absolutely there is a lot more content so this this course is divided into sections and each sections have a different sub sections so you and i have made a full syllabus talks what topics i'm going to cover in each and every topic or something a section divided in a sub section and you can assess the syllabus by visiting the course website the course website i premade with um are made with my friends friends of andrew so you can definitely go there and assess all the syllabus all the problem sets of this of this course and each and every section you will be you you'll be having one problem set and all of these is in the description down box below okay all of where the time stamps as well as the course world notes okay so are all available on the course website so you can go there see what's assignments are there complete that and join our discord server to just to discuss your assignments and you can also submit it through forum okay so this is the basic syllabus that we are going to follow and i really hope that it worked a lot in preparing the materials for this course teaching you all in the blackboard and understanding you're helping understand each and every topics of machine learning in a very very very easy way and this course has extensive syllabus a very good syllabus uh to um which i have which i haven't seen on youtube youtube okay so please be sure to see the syllabus what we are going to cover just have told you in in just shot the reason is i i want to just start with this uh video so i've given a shot you can see the syllabus by visiting our course website for absolutely free everything for absolutely free you can go to the course website which is the link in the description that box below so let's start with the section number one fundamentals of machine learning okay so now we'll start with machine learning in this section you will get an introduction to machine learning and we'll talk about introduction to machine learning types of machine learning and there are types and we'll see some cool applications and then we will see some problem of overfitting and under fitting and then we'll wrap up this section okay so let's start okay so now we'll answer a question what is machine learning and you may ask here you sure this is very uh can you tell what actually machine learning is yeah you will get to know more and more about what actually the big picture of machine learning means you in depth when when we will go through this course but in simple terms machine learning is like this computer programs that uses algorithms to analyze the data and make intelligent predictions based on the data without being explicitly programmed and you might think hey are you sure what is kind of this um it i'm getting a little bit confused no worries so let's um let's get into this and let me explain you what i'm saying over here in this blackboard so you are given a data you are given a data okay and then you give to the algorithm the algorithm the algorithm analyzes the data analyzes the data analyzes the data and whatever he has analyzed or learned from the data it makes predictions based onto that it makes predictions under that okay so specifically what we were the what what we are doing we want to make a function x that maps out input variable x to the output variable y and you may think here you're sure confusing me what is x what is y no worries x is the input feature x is the input feature means uh let's take a problem statement of predicting the house prices predicting the house prices okay so you want to do this so uh here on the basis of the size of the house so on the basis of size of the house you want to predict the price of the house okay so you give an input variable x and you get outward variable y okay so on the basis of the size of the house you want uh the price of the house okay so you wanted to make a function so you wanted to make a function f that takes input x and maps that to y and that's the definition of machine learning that's the beauty of machine learning so what we were doing we are we want to have we want to map our input variable x maybe it can be maybe the size of the house maybe the number of fans of the house maybe the number of our bedrooms in the house so i'm denoting with a subscript one subscript to subscript three and we want to make a function that maps these input variables to the output variable which which we did denote with y which is the price of the house and that's what and that we are doing and we will learn how to make this functions okay so that's the beauty of machine learning which you can see over here so let's see some of the more formal definitions which you will see you more over the internet then the machine learning is the field of study that gives computer the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed saved by author samuel but one definition that i said to use totally means if you if you if someone asks you hey hey whatever your name uh what is machine learning you just ask hey i i know a better way to define a machine learning you just make a fun geo just to make a function that maps your input variables to the output variable okay and that's the beauty or that that's called the machine learning and i hope that's you that you that you got it what i'm what i'm trying to say you hear and access are the input features that you that you wanted to on the basis of that these are the input input features and the basis of that you want to predict the price okay the another definition of machine learning is the computer program is say to the learn from the experience e with respect to the sum class of a task t and some performance measure by p if its performance on t as measure by p improves with experience e and this mean seems a little bit intimidating but let me clear this definition is very uh my my favorite definition although this this is my favorite definition that i've shown to you but let me tell you what the definition tells you the definition is so before that let me take one example which is let's take an example of checkers okay playing checkers playing checkers i hope that's you no no no let's let's take another because many other people do not play checkers over here okay so let's take a spammed email spam detection system email spam detection detection system which you will make in this course yeah you will make this course you will make this into the course okay so this is a problem statement and what's what's the let's fit that definition onto this problem here t is the detecting the emails means detecting whether the email is a spam or not so let's let's denote zero as uh detecting a spam or one as uh okay so let's say let's say ham and e is the experience of his prediction is the experience here e is the experience of detection and p is the performance how much performance increases upon to the experience so in this way higher the experience is best the system is but i think this is more formally fit to something called a reinforcement learning which will not see the advanced learning but again the definition which you have to take is you wanted to make a function of function f that maps your input variables to the output variable and that's machine learning and or you can say that's the beauty of machine learning okay so some of the applications of machine learning there is um i just liste
